This is a compilation of my first 9 projects for my college computer science class CS2050 (object oriented Java) 
There were 11 in total but this is the gist of it, mainly used for understanding how to manage data structures and how things like sorting algorithms work
This was my second java class and 4th coding class ever (app development in high school, intro to computer engineering, CS1050, and CS2050)

For future reference and a bit about me:
I am balancing being proficient in the hardware and software side of computers so I may try some leetcode here and there but thats about it for now
so I may also go quiet on github for a while, while I take hardware or math and general classes
I plan to take C programming for engineering in a couple of semesters
